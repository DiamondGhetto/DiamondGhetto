 ## 💎Hello world, I’m @DiamondGhetto I mean Daniele Morais💎
  ✨   I am a 27 year old black woman and Maria's daughter, I was born in northeast. What's the state? Recife-PE in Brazil.
    I have a cat called Ice which at the same time is very cute and mischievous. A curiosity about me? I prefer dulce de leche than chocolate. 
        Currently I decided becoming me a Dev so... I'm learning about the Java programming language on the DIO plataform. 
      Before that I was traveled for 3 months around Europe as a Worldpackers volunteer, in that time I had to opportunity to visit 2 countries Republic of Ireland and Netherlands.
- 💞️ I’m looking for tips how  to learn more faster and this way get a job quickly.
